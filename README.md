## Overview

The MoSeq2 toolkit enables users to model rodent behavior across different experimental groups, and
measure the differences between their behavior usages, durations, transition patterns. etc.

This package contains interactive jupyter notebooks that are tailored for novice programmers to process
their depth videos of rodents, and segment their behavior into what is denoted as "syllables".

Consult the wiki-page for a complete overview and description of the MoSeq pipeline [here](https://github.com/dattalab/moseq2-app/wiki).

__Note: The Notebook is currently in a testing phase and is subject to potential substantial changes.__

If you experience any issues using MoSeq or have comments on how you'd like to see
MoSeq improved, please [file an issue here](https://github.com/dattalab/moseq2-docs/issues) (but first [see if it's been addressed before](https://github.com/dattalab/moseq2-docs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed))
and/or fill out [this user survey](https://forms.gle/FbtEN8E382y8jF3p6).

Currently, we offer 3 notebooks that provide tutorials for using MoSeq's pipeline
to extract, preprocess, model, and perform basic analysis on experimental data. We
hope to expand our selection of notebooks based on user feedback and the
project's trajectory.

### The main MoSeq notebook ([link](./Main-MoSeq2-Notebook.ipynb))

A detailed and complete walk-through of the MoSeq pipeline â€” from data extraction to modeling.
It includes examples of what to expect at each step, and what to do if things don't go as expected.
There are also a few visualizations to help with extraction and modeling. 

### A notebook to explore modeling and experimental results interactively ([link](./Interactive-Model-Results-Exploration.ipynb))

A stand-alone notebook containing all the interactive data exploration tools for
modeled data. Simply enter the paths to your selected model(s) and index file
to use to syllable exploration tools.

### Flip Classifier Training Notebook ([link](./Flip%20Classifier%20Training%20Notebook.ipynb))

This notebook is a stand-alone tool that can be used to train a new 
flip classifier used to correct the orientation of the extracted animal. If's
utilized if the current flip classifier is not working as expected.
For example, the current flip classifier does not work well with datasets
acquired with the Azure or RealSense depth cameras.

### Our goal for the notebooks

These notebooks are built with the intention that users will copy and adapt them for
their specific needs once they feel comfortable with the MoSeq platform.

- [Getting started](#getting-started)

### Software Requirements

MoSeq2 is compatible with Windows, MacOS and many flavors of Linux. We've tested
Debian, CentOS, and Ubuntu. Use other Linux distributions at your own risk.

For Windows users, we recommend using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with the
Ubuntu distribution. This will allow you to use Linux within the Windows
operating system. To install WSL, follow the steps below.
 1. Enable WSL in Windows 10. Official instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) and unofficial instructions [here](https://winaero.com/blog/enable-wsl-windows-10-fall-creators-update/)
 2.  Download and install the Ubuntu distribution from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6?activetab=pivot:overviewtab). This step is included in the official instructions.

The following software packages are required to install and run the MoSeq pipeline.
Don't worry, we'll walk through installation steps for each of these packages in the
[Installation](#installation) section.
 - All Platforms:
     - anaconda3/miniconda3
     - git
     - curl (it should be installed by default on all systems)
     - gcc and g++: accepted and tested versions: 6, 7, and 9
     - [`moseq2-extract==0.6.0`](https://github.com/dattalab/moseq2-extract/blob/release/Documentation.pdf)
     - [`moseq2-pca==0.3.0`](https://github.com/dattalab/moseq2-pca/blob/release/Documentation.pdf)
     - [`moseq2-model==0.4.0`](https://github.com/dattalab/moseq2-model/blob/release/Documentation.pdf)
     - [`moseq2-viz==0.4.0`](https://github.com/dattalab/moseq2-viz/blob/release/Documentation.pdf)
 - CentOS:
     - libSM
 - macOS:
     - XCode command line tools


## Installation

You're going to need an open terminal to work through this installation guide. On
Mac, use `Terminal.app` or your favorite application. On Windows, open up a terminal
in WSL by starting the distribution application. On Linux, open up the `Terminal`
application.

### Anaconda/miniconda

First, check to see if you have Anaconda already installed in the terminal. Type `conda info` then hit enter. If you received something similar to: `command not found` instead
of a description of the current anaconda installation, you don't have anaconda
installed. Miniconda is the preferred version to install because it only installs
the essentials.

On Linux and WSL:
```bash
curl https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -o "$HOME/miniconda3_latest.sh"
chmod +x $HOME/miniconda3_latest.sh  # turn script into excutable
$HOME/miniconda3_latest.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda3
```
On MacOS:
```bash
curl https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh -o "$HOME/miniconda3_latest.sh"
chmod +x $HOME/miniconda3_latest.sh  # turn script into excutable
$HOME/miniconda3_latest.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda3
```
**NOTE: the `-b` flag installs miniconda in silent mode and assumes you accept
their license agreement. For more information, refer to the
[official documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/silent-mode/)**

If you prefer to install the Anaconda package, we refer you to the [official installation documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).

This will install a new python distribution as well as some essential tools, like `pip`,
which you can use to install other python packages.

You might need to restart your terminal and/or run `conda init` to initialize conda and
have it become recognized as a command.

### gcc

We're going to walk through the process of installing `gcc-7` but you can install any of the
supported versions listed above. Just replace `7` with the version you want to install.

To check if you have `gcc-7`/`g++-7` is installed, run this command:
```bash
which gcc-7
# or `which gcc` if your default version is in the working set of gcc versions. 
```
You should expect to see an outputted path to your gcc-7 installation, like this:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/gcc-7
```

If gcc-7/g++-7 cannot be found, then follow these steps to install them for your respective OS:

#### For macOS:

1. Install [brew](https://brew.sh/), the macOS package manager, via their website.
2. Install the xcode command line tools. Command: `xcode-select --install`
3. Install gcc: `brew install gcc@7`

#### For WSL/Linux:

<!-- TODO: check if the following sentence is true -->
The pre-installed `gcc` version should work out-of-the box with linux.
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt update
sudo apt install g++-7 -y
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-7 60 \
                         --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-7 
sudo update-alternatives --config gcc
gcc --version
g++ --version
```

Finally, for all platforms:

Confirm you have `gcc-7` installed by running:
```bash
which gcc-7
which g++-7
```

The following step is important installing the `moseq2-model` dependency.

Once you have confirmed gcc-7 is installed, run the next 2 commands to set them as default gcc versions.
It is also recommended to copy these two commands to your `~/.bashrc` file (for Linux and Windows)  
or `~/.bash_profile` file (for MacOS) to preserve this setting from now on. 

```bash
export CC="$(which gcc-7)"
export CXX="$(which g++-7)"
```

### Git

To check if you have it installed, run `which git`. If it prints a path to git,
you have it installed. Otherwise, refer to the [official installation guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git/).

### MoSeq2 packages and notebook

Now that we've handled the prerequisites, we can finally install MoSeq.

The optimal way to install MoSeq is automagically via a script we supply. But if you
run into trouble, you can run each of the commands from the script separately
to figure out where the problem lies. If you run into installation issues that you
can't figure out on your own or aren't documented here, please [sumbit an issue](https://github.com/dattalab/moseq2-docs/issues)

#### Pre-installation instructions

- download the `moseq2-app` GitHub repository, and navigate to it:
```bash
git clone -b release https://github.com/dattalab/moseq2-app.git
cd moseq2-app
```
You'll be asked for your github username and password since this is a private repository.

- We recommend that you create a new [conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html) named `moseq2-app`:
```bash
# assuming you're in the moseq2-app directory:
conda env create -n moseq2-app --file scripts/moseq2-env.yaml
```
If you're already a conda master, feel free to install MoSeq in any environment you want.
Just make sure the dependencies described in `scripts/moseq2-env.yaml` are installed in
that environment.

- activate the new conda environment
```bash
conda activate moseq2-app
```

- If on a mac, link to the gcc compilers via 2 environment variables (remember to replace `7` with the gcc version you have)
```bash
export CC="$(which gcc-7)"
export CXX="$(which g++-7)"
```

:bulb: **Helpful tip!** :bulb:

If you don't want to repeatedly type your GitHub username and password when installing
the MoSeq packages, you can set up `git` to temporarily remember them for 15 minutes:
```bash
git config credential.helper cache
```

#### Installing MoSeq

Make sure you're in the `moseq2-app` folder with your new conda environment activated
([see pre-installation instructions](#pre-installation-instructions))

Run:
```bash
./scripts/install_moseq2_app.sh
```

If you get any errors running that script, open the script in a text file and run each line
independently. This will help you (and us) figure out where the error is occuring.

You can view your conda environments by running the following command:
```bash
conda env list
```

## Downloading a test dataset

To try MoSeq2 on some sample data, we have provided 2 scripts to either download
the complete 48 session dataset, or a smaller dataset with 20 total sessions,
10 of each experimental group.

Run the following command in the `moseq2-app` directory
```bash
./scripts/download_small_dataset.sh  # or ./scripts/download_full_dataset.sh
```

The shell scripts will create a new folder within `moseq2-app` to download the data.
Be warned, this process will take a long time to finish (hours), and requires 20-60 GB
of disk space.
<!-- with a copy of the `Main-MoSeq2-Notebook`.  -->

## Getting started
<!-- Once, the download is complete, navigate to that directory and launch the jupyter notebook (within the activated conda env). -->
To use the notebooks, make sure your environment is activated and your current directory includes 
the notebooks you would like to use. 

__NOTE: It is important for the notebook to be run from the parent directory 
of your dataset in order for the videos to be displayed.__ 

Run the following command to launch the jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```  

## (Optional) Building and re-generating documentation

All documentation regarding moseq2-extract can be found in the `Documentation.pdf` file in the root directory,
an HTML ReadTheDocs page can be generated via running the `make html` in the `docs/` directory.

MoSeq2 uses `sphinx` to generate the html and pdf documentation. To install `sphinx`, follow the commands below:
```.bash
pip install sphinx==3.0.3
pip install sphinx-rtd-theme
pip install rst2pdf
``` 

To generate a PDF version of the documentation, simply run `make pdf` in the `docs/` directory.
